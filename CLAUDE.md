# Nelson

Nelson is a Claude Code skill for coordinating agent work using Royal Navy terminology. It provides an eight-step operational framework: Sailing Orders, The Estimate, Battle Plan, Form the Squadron, Get Permission to Sail, Quarterdeck Rhythm, Action Stations, and Stand Down.

## Maintainability sensors

This repo has automated sensors that you (the agent) should run and read
carefully before considering a task done. They're how the codebase gives you
fast feedback about whether your changes are maintainable.

### Active sensors

- **Linter** — `ruff check`. Config in `pyproject.toml`. AI-targeted
  thresholds (`max-args=5`, `max-branches=10`, `max-statements=50`,
  `max-complexity=10`, `line-length=120`). Each violation message is
  feedback — read it, don't just look at the line. Many rules accept a
  suppress-with-reason or threshold-bump instead of forcing a fix.
- **Formatter** — `ruff format --check`. Apply with `ruff format` before
  committing.
- **Tests** — run separately per directory because each has its own
  `conftest.py`:

  ```
  pytest skills/nelson/scripts/ -v
  pytest hooks/ -v
  pytest scripts/ -v
  ```

- **Pre-commit** — `pre-commit run --all-files`. Includes secret scanning
  (Gitleaks), Ruff, and standard hygiene. Install once with
  `pre-commit install`. If a hook fails, fix the underlying issue rather
  than passing `--no-verify`.
- **CI** — the same checks re-run on clean infra after push (see
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml`). Green locally + red in CI usually means
  environment drift (Python version, env vars, OS-specific paths).

### Suppressing or bumping a sensor

You may suppress a rule or bump a threshold when the rule is clearly wrong
for the situation. **The reason is mandatory.**

```python
result = subprocess.run(  # noqa: S603 -- args are repo-internal paths, sys.executable is trusted
    [sys.executable, str(_SCRIPT), ...],
    ...,
)
```

Naked suppressions (no `--` reason) are not acceptable — they're noise and
they hide the next regression. If you find existing naked suppressions,
treat them as a mini code-review task: add a reason or remove the
suppression.

If a threshold (`max-complexity`, `max-args`, `line-length`, etc.) needs to
go up project-wide, change it in `pyproject.toml` and add a comment
explaining the trade-off. Don't disable the rule entirely — leaving the
rule active means it will catch the *next* drift.

**Why this matters:** every suppress-with-reason line and every
threshold-bump comment is itself a *review anchor*. With a sensor-aware
workflow, those lines are the durable record of "we considered this, and
here's why we accepted it." Write the reasons accordingly: aim for *the
next reader can decide whether this is still a good idea*, not *I want the
lint to stop yelling*.

### Brownfield complexity backlog

The largest functions carry `# noqa: C901, PLR0912, PLR0915` suppressions
pointing to **beads issue `nelson-e6j`**. When you touch one of those
functions, check whether your edit reduces complexity below the
threshold. If yes, drop the noqa. If no, leave the noqa and the backlog
entry in place — the refactor stays opportunistic, not blocking. The
goal is to avoid the perverse incentive to leave flagged functions
untouched.

### When sensors disagree with you

Sensors are heuristics, not laws. If you genuinely believe a rule is wrong
for a particular file or function, propose the threshold change or
per-directory override explicitly — don't reach for a suppression as a
shortcut. Discussion in a comment / PR description beats a silent disable.
