# The Estimate

The analytical phase between Sailing Orders and Battle Plan. Read this when conducting The Estimate.

The Royal Navy's 7 Question Maritime Tactical Estimate drives the thinking that turns a mission brief into a plan worth executing. Nelson the admiral used a version of it to produce his Trafalgar Memorandum — the document that gave every captain enough understanding of his intent to act independently when the signal flags were lost in the smoke.

## The seven questions

| # | Name | What it answers |
|---|------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Reconnaissance** | What is the terrain? What are we working with? |
| 2 | **Intent** | What are we really trying to achieve, and why? |
| 3 | **Effects** | What changes must occur to fulfil the intent? |
| 4 | **Terrain** | Where in the codebase does each effect land? |
| 5 | **Forces** | What agents, models, and context do we need? |
| 6 | **Coordination** | What depends on what? What runs in parallel? |
| 7 | **Control** | Where are the quality gates and intervention points? |

The numbering carries a thought-process, not a form. Short answers for simple missions; deeper analysis for complex ones. Always seven questions.

## Interactive flow

The Estimate is a conversation between admiral and user, not a monologue. Respect the user's time.

**Q1 — Reconnaissance.** The first question that dispatches sub-agents. Send one or more Explore agents into the codebase with a scouting brief derived from the Sailing Orders. For ambiguous or unfamiliar terrain, dispatch them in parallel with different search targets. Synthesise their reports into a terrain assessment in your own voice. Do not paste raw agent output into the estimate.

**Q1 Explorer discipline:**
- Default to **multiple focused Explores** rather than one laundry-list dispatch. Each Explore covers one subsystem or one specific question. Ten files or one module is a working ceiling per dispatch.
- Each Explore brief MUST require a **structured summary** — list of `{file_path, finding, evidence}` or equivalent. Do not request raw file contents; the admiral synthesises across summaries.
- If only one dispatch is genuinely warranted (small repo, narrow question, single subsystem) and Explore's prompt limits are a concern, use `subagent_type=general-purpose` with an explicit "return a structured summary; do not return raw file contents" instruction.
- Estimate Explorers inherit the admiral's model. The cost-savings default of haiku for narrow Explorers does not apply during The Estimate (see `references/model-selection.md`).
- When an Explore fails (prompt-length limit, malformed output, error), apply `references/standing-orders/pulling-the-oar.md`: fix the brief and re-dispatch. Do not absorb the work into the admiral's context.

**Checkpoint 1 — after Q1.** Present findings to the user:

> *"Here is what I found. Is there anything I have missed? Are there additional constraints I should know?"*

This is also the natural point for **mission reframing**. If reconnaissance reveals the stated mission will not achieve the user's actual intent, say so plainly and propose a reframing. The user confirms, amends, or overrides. If the mission is reframed, amend `sailing-orders.json` and preserve the original as context.

**Dispatch 1 — Q2 and Q3 (Estimate-Drafter).** Q2 and Q3 are delegated to a single subagent. Q2 derives the commander's intent from the Q1 reconnaissance and Sailing Orders — one paragraph that will travel with every captain's brief. Q3 decomposes the intent into concrete effects, each carrying commander's guidance and acceptance criteria (see below).

The admiral writes the briefing to `{mission-dir}/estimate-briefing-1.md` so it survives compaction, then references it in the `Agent` prompt. Briefing contents:
- Sailing orders (full content, not just summary).
- Pointer to `{mission-dir}/estimate.md` containing the Q1 reconnaissance synthesis.
- Output requirements: H2 sections for Q2 (Intent) and Q3 (Effects); voice and register from this document.
- Mission directory path so the subagent writes to the correct file.
- User-stated preferences captured in conversation but not in sailing orders (e.g. "admiral must not implement", "cost-savings enabled"). The admiral surfaces these from its own context — they are the gap formal sailing orders typically miss.
- Pointer to this file (`references/the-estimate.md`) for thought-process detail.

The subagent appends Q2 and Q3 sections to `{mission-dir}/estimate.md`.

**Checkpoint 2 — after Q3.** Present intent and effects to the user:

> *"Here is what I believe needs to happen and why. Does this match your understanding?"*

This is the substantive gate — the user is approving *what* will be done before you plan *how*.

**Dispatch 2 — Q4 through Q7 (Estimate-Planner).** A second subagent reads the approved Q1–Q3 sections from `{mission-dir}/estimate.md` and produces Terrain (Q4), Forces (Q5), Coordination (Q6), and Control (Q7) — the admiral's professional judgement about execution.

Briefing contents (`{mission-dir}/estimate-briefing-2.md`):
- Pointer to `{mission-dir}/estimate.md` containing approved Q1–Q3 sections.
- Output requirements: H2 sections for Q4–Q7; voice and register from this document.
- Mission directory path so the subagent appends to the correct file.
- User-stated preferences captured in conversation but not in sailing orders.
- Pointer to this file for thought-process detail.

The subagent appends Q4–Q7 sections to `{mission-dir}/estimate.md`. The admiral then presents the complete estimate for final review.

**Model inheritance.** Both Estimate subagents omit the `model:` parameter on the `Agent` tool call — they inherit the admiral's model. This holds even when sailing orders specify cost-savings, per `references/model-selection.md`.

**Final review.** Present the complete estimate. The user approves, requests amendments, or overrides specific questions. On approval, advance the phase from `ESTIMATE` to `BATTLE_PLAN`.

## Checkpoint discipline

Checkpoints are *available*, not *mandatory*. Collapse to a single end-of-estimate review when **all three** conditions hold:

1. The Sailing Orders specify outcome, metric, and deadline.
2. Reconnaissance (Q1) reveals no surprises requiring reframing.
3. The work lands in a single subsystem or file.

Outside that narrow case, the two-checkpoint flow is the default. If in doubt, checkpoint.

## Effects, acceptance criteria, and commander's guidance

Each effect in the Effects section (Q3) carries three elements:

```markdown
### Effect: Replace session auth with JWT signing

Lands on `src/auth/session.ts`. High complexity.

**Commander's guidance:** Use the `jose` library, ES256 algorithm,
15-minute expiry with refresh rotation.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- All 47 existing auth tests pass without modification
- New unit tests cover token signing, verification, and expiry
- No runtime dependency on Redis for authentication
- Token payload contains only `sub`, `iat`, `exp` claims
```

- **The effect** states what must change (outcome-focused).
- **Commander's guidance** states how it should be done — library choices, patterns, design decisions. Specific enough to prevent wrong turns, loose enough to allow professional judgement.
- **Acceptance criteria** state what must be true when the effect is complete. Each criterion must have an appropriate verification method: existing test suites, type-checkers, linters, review agents, and visual inspection are all valid. Not every criterion demands a new unit test.

Acceptance criteria flow through the pipeline:

1. **Battle Plan** — each task inherits the criteria of its parent effect.
2. **Captains** — know what "done" looks like before writing a line of code. They pick the appropriate verification method per criterion.
3. **Quarterdeck** — verifies every criterion and records both outcome (`pass` / `fail` / `not-verified`) and method used via `nelson-data.py estimate-outcome`.

## Adaptive planning — dated addenda

The Estimate is a living document, not a contract. When you or a captain encounter something that contradicts the estimate — a file more complex than expected, a dependency not apparent, an approach that proves unworkable — amend the relevant section with a dated addendum:

```markdown
## Addendum — 14:32

Reconnaissance assumed `src/auth/session.ts` was a single-concern module.
In practice it also owns refresh token rotation and rate-limit state.
Effects revised: the original signing effect now splits into two.
Coordination updated accordingly.
```

The original reasoning stays visible. The course correction is explicit. Downstream plans adjust.

## Voice and register

Write as a capable officer briefing peers. Concise but never terse. Clear but never flat. Confident but never glib. Cross-references between questions use natural prose, not IDs or schemas — the Battle Plan step reads the estimate in context, and it is the same admiral reading its own work.

## Output

A single markdown file, `{mission-dir}/estimate.md`, with one H2 section per question:

```
{mission-dir}/estimate.md
  ## 1. Reconnaissance
  ## 2. Intent
  ## 3. Effects
  ## 4. Terrain
  ## 5. Forces
  ## 6. Coordination
  ## 7. Control
```

If a section grows unwieldy during a complex mission, split it into its own file at `{mission-dir}/estimate/0N-name.md` and leave a prose pointer in the parent. The default is one file — splitting is the exception, not the rule.

See `admiralty-templates/estimate.md` for the skeleton to work from.
