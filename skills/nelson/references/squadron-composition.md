# Squadron Composition Reference

Use this file to choose execution mode and team size.

## Mode Selection

**User preference override:** If the user explicitly requests a specific execution mode (e.g., "use agent teams"), that request MUST be honoured. User preference takes priority over the decision matrix below. Do not second-guess or override the user's choice.

Evaluate all five conditions and select the best fit. When two modes could apply, prefer the one that gives captains more autonomy while preserving required human gates.

- `single-session`: Work is sequential, tightly coupled, or mostly in the same files.
- `subagents`: Work is parallel and each captain's task is fully independent — no shared coordination surface needed.
- `agent-team`: Work is parallel and captains benefit from a shared task list, peer messaging, or coordinated deliverables. Also use when 4+ captains are needed, or when the user requests it.
- `workflow`: Work is a single approved dynamic workflow run with large fan-out, repeatable review or migration logic, codebase-wide audit scope, or cross-checked research. Treat the workflow as one fleet asset, not as ordinary captains.
- `hybrid-workflow`: Work is a Nelson-gated sequence of workflow stages. Use when a probe, Station 2/3 sign-off, or human approval is required between workflow runs.

## Decision Matrix

| Condition | Preferred Mode | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Single critical path, low ambiguity | `single-session` | Lowest coordination overhead |
| Parallel, fully independent tasks | `subagents` | Independent tasks with no cross-captain dependencies |
| Parallel implementation with dependencies | `agent-team` | Supports teammate-to-teammate coordination |
| 4+ parallel captains | `agent-team` | Shared task list simplifies coordination at scale |
| High threat or high blast radius | `agent-team` + red-cell navigator | Adds explicit control points |
| Large repeatable audit, migration, or research fan-out | `workflow` | Dynamic workflow scripts can orchestrate many agents and aggregate results |
| Workflow-suitable mission with stage gates or Station 2/3 approvals | `hybrid-workflow` | Human approval happens between separate workflow runs |
| User explicitly requests a mode | As requested | User preference overrides the matrix |

Before selecting `workflow` or `hybrid-workflow`, read `workflow-doctrine.md` and record the workflow suitability, probe, verification contract, cost guardrail, and fallback mode in the battle plan. Nelson v1 produces a workflow charter; it does not directly generate or launch `.claude/workflows/*.js`.

## Team Sizing

The right number of captains equals the number of independently executable work units — not a complexity tier. Before choosing a number, map the dependency graph and count how many tasks can run concurrently with zero shared state. That count is the target.

**Zero shared state** means: no file ownership overlap AND no sequencing dependency (task B does not require the output of task A). Peer coordination across module boundaries (e.g., agreeing on an API contract) is permitted and handled by the admiral.

- Assign one captain per independent work unit.
- Only merge tasks onto one captain when they share files, have a sequencing dependency, or are so small that agent setup cost clearly exceeds the work itself.
- Add `1 red-cell navigator` at medium/high threat.
- Keep one admiral only.
- Squadron cap: 10 squadron-level agents (admiral, captains, red-cell navigator). Crew are additional — up to 4 per captain, governed by `references/crew-roles.md`.

An analysis mission with 8 independent sections warrants 8 captains. An implementation mission with 3 independent modules warrants 3. When in doubt, add a captain — idle context is cheap; serialized work is slow. In cost-optimized missions (sailing orders with token-budget priority), consult `references/model-selection.md` before defaulting to maximum parallelism.

## Role Guide

- `admiral`: Defines sailing orders, delegates, tracks dependencies, resolves blockers. May perform read-only recombination of completed ship outputs once all ships have reported successfully, but MUST NOT perform generative synthesis directly — assign a captain or dedicate a synthesis task for that.
- `captain`: Commands a ship. Breaks task into sub-tasks, coordinates crew, verifies outputs. Implements directly only when the task is atomic (0 crew). Initial crew composition is set by the admiral at formation; captains may request mid-task adjustments with admiral approval.
  - Crew roles: Executive Officer (XO), Principal Warfare Officer (PWO), Navigating Officer (NO), Marine Engineering Officer (MEO), Weapon Engineering Officer (WEO), Logistics Officer (LOGO), Coxswain (COX). See `references/crew-roles.md` for role definitions and crewing rules.
- `red-cell navigator`: Challenges assumptions, validates outputs, checks rollback readiness.

## Anti-Patterns

See the Standing Orders table in SKILL.md for the full list of standing orders and known anti-patterns.

## Worktree Isolation

When file ownership boundaries are hard to draw or multiple captains must modify overlapping files, use `isolation: "worktree"` on the `Agent` tool. This gives each captain an isolated copy of the repository via a git worktree.

Worktree isolation is a stronger alternative to the file-ownership approach in `standing-orders/split-keel.md`. Use it when:

- Multiple captains need to edit the same files.
- Merge conflict risk is high and the split-keel standing order cannot resolve it.
- Tasks are large enough that the merge cost is justified.

**Trade-off:** Worktree isolation prevents conflicts during execution but requires merging changes afterward. The admiral is responsible for coordinating the merge.
