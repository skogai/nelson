Conflict Radar for Nelson Missions.

This script monitors for file conflicts by comparing active git changes
against the `battle-plan.md` file ownership declarations. It raises an
alert if a changed file has no registered owner in the battle plan.

Limitation: This script uses ``git status`` to detect changed files globally.
It cannot determine which agent made a change, so it can only flag files that
have no registered owner — not cross-ship violations (Ship A writing to Ship B's
files). For true cross-ship detection, per-agent change tracking would be needed.

Usage (manual invocation):
  python3 skills/nelson/scripts/nelson_conflict_radar.py --plan .nelson/missions/<your-mission-dir>/battle-plan.md

Opt-in hook configuration (add to settings.json PostToolUse hooks if desired):
  Recommended guard to only run during active Nelson missions:
    if [ -d .nelson/missions ]; then python3 skills/nelson/scripts/nelson_conflict_radar.py --plan <path>; fi

  Note: Running this as a default PostToolUse hook is NOT recommended — it is
  too expensive to run on every tool use and will cause issues in non-Nelson
  projects. Opt in manually by adding the hook command to your settings.json
  and supplying the explicit --plan path.

Depends on: nelson_conflict_scan.py (shared parse_battle_plan logic from PR #73).
